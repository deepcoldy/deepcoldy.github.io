# Scheduled Tasks

Supports three schedule types plus natural-language input, posting a follow-up message in **the original topic where the task was created** and executing it when due (no separate thread is opened; the working directory matches the one at creation time).

## Two Ways to Create

* **Slash command** (quick): `/schedule 每日17:50 帮我看看AI圈有什么新闻`
* **Conversational trigger** (flexible): just tell the agent "add me a scheduled task to check deployment every day at 18:00", which automatically triggers the `botmux-schedule` skill.

## Supported Formats

```bash
# Chinese natural language
/schedule 每日17:50 帮我看看AI圈有什么新闻
/schedule 工作日每天9:00 检查服务状态
/schedule 每周一10:00 生成周报

# One-time tasks
/schedule 30分钟后 检查部署状态
/schedule 明天9:00 发早会提醒

# English duration / interval / cron
/schedule every 2h 巡检服务
/schedule 30m 提醒我喝水
/schedule 0 9 * * * 早安问候

# ISO timestamp
/schedule 2026-05-01T10:00 ...
```

## A New Topic Per Run

By default every fire continues in **the original topic where the task was created**. To make each run land in a **brand-new topic** in the same chat with its own isolated session (ideal for daily-report style tasks where each run should stand alone), there are three ways:

```bash
# Slash command: prefix the prompt with the 新话题 ("new topic") keyword
/schedule 每日17:30 新话题 generate today's discussion digest

# CLI: --new-topic flag
botmux schedule add "每日17:30" "generate digest" --new-topic

# CLI: equivalent --deliver form
botmux schedule add "每日17:30" "generate digest" --deliver new-topic
```

You can also flip an existing task between "original thread" and "new topic each run" from the **Delivery** column toggle on the dashboard's Schedules page.

## Follow the Active Topic

A topic-pinned task keeps firing into the topic it was created in; once that topic is closed and the conversation has moved on, reminders land where nobody is looking — and re-lighting a closed topic is one more topic session to carry. `--follow-active` makes the task re-resolve its target **at every fire**.

```bash
# Created from inside a topic session: that topic is the starting point
botmux schedule add "every 30m" "check the service, alert only on failure" --follow-active

# Or give the starting point explicitly
botmux schedule add "每日9:00" "standup reminder" --follow-active --root-msg-id om_xxx
```

Tried in order at every fire:

1. **The last landing point is still open and a human has spoken in it** (some bot still holds an active session under that topic, and that session has seen a human message) ⇒ fire there, even if the person spoke elsewhere more recently. Until the first fire, the last landing point is the creation topic.
2. **Otherwise** (closed; or open but only bots ever wrote there) ⇒ fire into the topic in this chat where a **human most recently spoke**, and record it as the new landing point. Only human messages count — bot replies and scheduled-task output are ignored, otherwise a task firing every 30 minutes would keep its own topic "most active" and follow itself forever. The lookup spans every bot: where the person is, is a property of the person, not of one bot. Note that this fire is injected into the person's live session, so the task's own `--workdir` does not apply there; the session's working directory is used.
3. **No open topic with human activity in this chat, but the last landing point is still open** (e.g. the topic step 4 opened, with only the task writing in it) ⇒ stay there; no new topic is opened.
4. **Nothing open at all** ⇒ this fire opens a fresh top-level topic, exactly like `--new-topic`, and records it as the new landing point — the next fire stays in it under step 3, and once the person replies there it is held under step 1.

Step 1 requiring a human is deliberate: a topic the task opened itself must not pin the task, so a bot-only landing point yields to any topic where a person is. If the session records cannot be read (e.g. sqlite temporarily unavailable) the task does not move and keeps its last landing point. A silent task reaching step 4 gets a deferred topic (created by the first `botmux send`), which is not recorded; the next fire re-resolves.

Cross-topic notice: a plain topic-pinned task that fires somewhere other than its creation topic posts a "delivered to …" notice back into the creation topic. A follow-active task moves by design, so it posts that notice only when it fires into a **different chat**; a move within the same chat just posts the "task started" banner in the topic it landed in.

`--follow-active` only makes sense for topic execution and cannot be combined with `--top-level` / `--new-topic`. Tasks of this kind show a `↷跟随活跃话题` marker in `schedule list`.

## Management

```bash
/schedule list
/schedule remove|enable|disable|run <id>
```

> Execution behavior: when due, if the session in the original topic is still alive, the prompt is injected directly into the existing session (no new worker is started); otherwise a new worker is spun up to execute in the original working directory. A `--new-topic` task always opens a fresh topic + new session and never reuses a prior one.
