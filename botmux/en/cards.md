# Streaming Cards

Every conversation turn produces a live-updating Lark card, your primary window for **perceiving and controlling the CLI** on your phone or in Lark.

* **Live screenshots of the terminal refreshed onto the card**: xterm renders headlessly into an image that **faithfully reproduces the CLI's TUI** (borders and colors are all there), instead of converting output to Markdown. One click to "Show / Hide output," "Export text," and "Half-page up / down."
* **Live status indicator**: the card's header color *is* the status (a Lark card template, not an emoji dot in the body) — **Starting…** (yellow) → **Working** (blue) → **Waiting for input** (green); when the quota is used up it shows **Limit reached** (red), turning to **Retryable** (green) when it can retry.
* **Operate directly from the card**: open the Web terminal, 🔑 grab an operation link, close the session, and — when the quota is retryable — "🔁 Resend last task."
* **A fresh card per turn**: the previous card freezes as an archive, keeping conversation history clear and traceable; after a session is moved to another group with [`/relay`](/botmux/en/relay.md), the original card also automatically freezes as an archive (buttons removed).
* **A "recoverable" card on close**: it carries a "▶️ Resume session" button to click back in anytime; **if the CLI supports native resume** (the adapter implements `buildResumeCommand` and a native session id exists), it also includes the native command (e.g. `claude --resume <id>`) for manual recovery; when unsupported, only botmux's resume button plus a short note is shown.

> **Open terminal = read-only**: the card's main "🖥️ Open Web Terminal" button is read-only viewing; for **writable** control, tap "🔑 Get operation link" — delivered **privately**: a flat group prefers an in-chat "visible-to-you" ephemeral card (so you never leave the conversation), falling back to a DM only for topic/thread or p2p chats, or when the ephemeral card fails. Management buttons like "🔄 Restart" and "apply profile" live on the **session card**, not on each turn's streaming card.

## Interrupting / correcting a running turn

To stop or correct it mid-turn, **don't wait for it to finish**: in screenshot mode the card carries a row of quick keys at the bottom — **Esc, ^C, Tab, Space, Enter, arrow keys, ⇞ Half-page up / ⇟ Half-page down**. Tapping `Esc` writes the ESC byte straight into the live terminal (exactly like pressing Esc locally); `^C` likewise. After interrupting, just add a new instruction.

> This quick-key row only appears when **output is shown (screenshot mode)** and the backend isn't `riff` — "Show output" first, then Esc is available. The default behavior is not to interrupt the current turn; new messages queue (type-ahead) and are fed in after the turn ends. To correct immediately, use Esc to break first.

## Messages the CLI proactively sends

The card body is a **live screenshot (image)** of the terminal, not text rendering. Messages the CLI proactively sends (via `botmux send`) are separate rich-text / image-and-text messages that can carry images, files, and @mentions; for fully custom display, `--card-file` / `--card-json` can send raw interactive card JSON.

> ⚠️ Raw cards allow **display-only elements + open\_url buttons only**: any callback-firing control — callback buttons (with a `value`), dropdown / person selects, date-time pickers, inputs, form submits — is rejected. This prevents custom cards from forging interactive callbacks.

## Updating a card after sending (card patch)

A successful `botmux send --card-file/--card-json` prints `{"success":true,"messageId":"om_...",...}`. `botmux card patch` updates that same card **in place** by its messageId — no new message, same chat/topic — which makes it ideal for progress cards:

```bash
# 1. Send an "in progress" card and grab its messageId from the JSON output
botmux send --card-json '{"schema":"2.0","header":{"template":"blue","title":{"tag":"plain_text","content":"Deploy progress"}},"body":{"direction":"vertical","elements":[{"tag":"markdown","content":"Progress: 0%"}]}}' --no-mention
# → {"success":true,"messageId":"om_xxx","sessionId":"..."}

# 2. Extract the messageId with jq, then patch it to 50%
MID=$(botmux send --card-file /tmp/progress.json --no-mention | jq -r .messageId)
botmux card patch --message-id "$MID" --card-json '{"schema":"2.0","header":{"template":"blue","title":{"tag":"plain_text","content":"Deploy progress"}},"body":{"direction":"vertical","elements":[{"tag":"markdown","content":"Progress: 50%"}]}}'

# 3. Patch once more when done
botmux card patch --message-id "$MID" --card-json '{"schema":"2.0","header":{"template":"green","title":{"tag":"plain_text","content":"Deploy done"}},"body":{"direction":"vertical","elements":[{"tag":"markdown","content":"✅ Shipped"}]}}'
```

* The replacement card JSON goes through the **same safety validation** as sending (display-only + open\_url; callback controls are rejected).
* The `send` examples pass `--no-mention`: a progress card doesn't need to @ anyone, and explicitly opting out avoids the mention-policy gate (exit 2).
* Bot identity is resolved from the session context (same as `send`); errors such as a withdrawn message, missing permission, or a non-card target are surfaced as-is (exit 1).
* Success prints `{"success":true,"messageId":"om_xxx","sessionId":"..."}` (JSON only on stdout); usage errors exit 2.
